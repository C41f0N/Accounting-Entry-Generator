# Accounting Entry Generator

Makes it easier to write entries in bulk. Made it to do my FOA project last minute.

## How is works?
It has classes made for most types of entries that go into an accounting general journal. You need to just make instances and call the toString function on them to get a string that can be pasted in excel directly. You can write entries in bulk and write them to a file, the contents of which you can copy and paste directly in excel.
